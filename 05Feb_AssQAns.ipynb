    "## Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting access to certain details of an object to prevent unauthorized modification. This is typically achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort. Abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces, which define methods without implementing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (called a child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between different classes. The subclass can extend or modify the behavior of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding). Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types)."
